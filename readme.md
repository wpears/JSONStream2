Reimplementation of Dominic Tarr's [JSONStream](https://github.com/dominictarr/JSONStream) module using [Through2](https://github.com/rvagg/through2).

By leaning on [readable-stream](https://github.com/iojs/readable-stream), this will allow less version and upgrade friction.

Another goal is providing easy access to array elements with a syntax cue in the path.
